        <div class="about-team">
            <p>At <strong>Mreva Media</strong>, we don't just take pictures we tell stories.
                Based in Mandeni KwaZulu-Natal, we are a creative production company specializing in high-quality photography and videography for all occasions. 
                From weddings and parties to corporate shoots and personal portraits, our mission is simple: capture moments that matter.</p>
            <h4>Our Journey</h4>
            <p><strong>Mreva Media</strong> started with a camera, a passion, and a bold idea to capture the moments that truly matter. 
                What began as weekend shoots and small events quickly turned into a full-scale visual production company trusted by clients across KwaZulu-Natal and nearest provinces. 
                Over time, we've refined our craft through every frame, every edit, and every shoot. We've worked behind the scenes at weddings, corporate events, private functions, 
                and content shoots, always chasing that perfect shot that tells a real story.
                From humble beginnings to becoming a creative team that thrives on detail and energy, our journey is built on consistency, 
                trust, and the love for making memories last.</p>

            <p>To capture real emotion and authentic moments through professional photography and videography providing high-quality,

            <h4>What Drives Us</h4>
            <p>We're obsessed with good lighting, natural emotion, and clean edits. 
                Our goal isn't just to make your photos look good, it's to make them feel real. 
                Every frame is crafted with precision, using top-tier equipment and a creative eye that sees more than just the surface.</p>
